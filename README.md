DCM - DSA Character Manager
===

An online resource for managing character sheets of the German Pen’n’Paper RPG DSA (Das Schwarze Auge / The Black Eye).

## Features

Character display, creation and editing, though no rules are enforced.

The character’s data are available in three different pages: 
* mundane character sheet (skills)
* magic character sheet (spells and rituals)
* ordained character sheet (liturgies)

## Installation

Install *Node.js*, *npm* and *MongoDB*, the remainder will be taken care of by *npm* when you build the dependencies.

For the character sheets to be of any use, you need to insert skills (Wege des Schwerts), spells (Liber Cantiones Deluxe), rituals (Wege der Zauberei) and liturgies (Wege der Götter / Liber Liturgium) manually into the DB via *db.js* (cf. copyright).
